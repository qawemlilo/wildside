PDFTouch SDK offers you a solid framework that's easy to use and customize to your needs. With just a couple of lines of code you can create a PDF view controller and present it in your app! The user interface is very similar to the iBooks app and also features a grid display for page thumbnails. For more details please refer to the **Features** section.
